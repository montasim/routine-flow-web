Building block for the yearly discipline heatmap (one cell per day).

```jsx
{days.map(d => <HeatmapCell key={d.date} rate={d.rate} title={`${d.date} · ${Math.round(d.rate*100)}%`} />)}
```

Pass `rate` (0–1) to auto-bucket onto the 5-step discipline ramp, or `level` (0–4) directly. Lay out 7 rows (weekdays) × 53 columns with a small gap.
